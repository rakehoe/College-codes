        <b>Bouncing Ball</b>
        <pre id="Mtext">
            The bouncing ball technique conveys realism by mimicking how a real ball behaves under the influence of gravity and momentum. 
            By showing how the ball accelerates on its way down and decelerates as it reaches its peak height, 
            animators can create a believable sense of weight.

            Bouncing a ball seems like a simple exercise to complete, however there are some fundamental aspects that
            must be outlined, such the key principles of animation required when animating. 
            When animating a ball we will be focusing on 6 of the 12 principles of animation, 
            these are: 
            
            Timing and Spacing, 
            
            Pose to pose/Straight ahead, 
            
            Ease in/Ease out, 
            
            Squash and stretch, 
            
            Solid form and Archs.

            Anticipation is the preparation for an action such as a jump or a punch. For example, a character will squat
            down before pushing his body and legs up into a jump. The stronger the anticipation motion, the more
            cartoony and fluid the animation will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anticipation refers to a brief moment of action that precedes the main action of an animated scene. Almost
            all real movements contain preparation for it – squatting before jumping, crouching down before running,
            swinging before throwing a stone, etc. This moment necessarily should be a part of an animated video.
            Therefore, if animators add an anticipation drawing to their works, the audience will be prepared for the
            main action in the scene. This would help to make the action appear more realistic. Moreover, the audience
            can always see everything clearly, so that they can foresee what is about to happen.

            Secondary action refers to the actions that support or emphasize the main action to breathe more life into
            the animation and create a more convincing performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an additional action that supports the main act. A secondary action is an integral part of animation
            as it adds interest and realism to the scene. It originates from immediate action, such as when someone’s
            arm moves backward after throwing something forward.
            Secondary actions are helpful when animating something like a walk cycle where one leg will swing forward
            while the other steps backward, creating balance as you go along with your motion. Hence, not all weight
            falls onto just one side making things look less stiff than they would otherwise be without this addition.

            “Follow-through” refers to a short moment after the main action. It is the idea that body parts of
            characters or elements of animated objects might continue to move even after a motion is completed. This
            effect is also called anti-anticipation.

            Preparation and recovery moments in action
            Every primary action (a jump, a bow, a twirl) has a moment of preparation and a moment of recovery. This
            moment necessarily should be a part of an animated video. “Follow through” makes the action more realistic
            and easy to believe.

            A walk cycle is an animation technique using illustrated frames stitched together to create a sense of
            movement. The series of frames contains consecutive drawings of a walking figure. When combined together,
            the animation appears to walk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In animation, a walk cycle is a series of frames or illustrations drawn in sequence that loop to create an
            animation of a walking character. The walk cycle is looped over and over, thus avoiding having to animate
            each step again.

            Arc is the movement in circular paths. Human beings do not move in one straight direction. They move in
            arcs. In the same way, the arc technique is to help animation create that illusion of movement — for
            example, the bouncing of the ball, as shown in the illustration below.
        </p>
        <p>
            The movements and actions that we see in nature and living beings in our day to day lives are very rarely
            mechanical in and out or up and down motions. Generally, most living creatures follow an implied curved
            path, also known as an “arc”.
            Meaning to say that all the actions that we generally see in our day to day lives follow arcs.
